# Scalable Semi-Supervised Learning with Variational Autoencoders
This repo implements a series of semi-supervised variational autoencoding models in [Theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/) using [theanomodels](https://github.com/clinicalml/theanomodels) as a framework.

### Introduction to Semi Supervised Learning with VAEs
The goal of semi-supervised learning is to improve the performance of a supervised learning classifier using unlabeled data.  Semi-supervised learning is very natural with variational autoencoders.  We formulate the problem as follows:
